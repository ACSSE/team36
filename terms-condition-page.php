                        <p>The Terms and Conditions are severable - that is, should any clause or part thereof be found to be illegal and/or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision will be deemed to have been deleted without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms and Conditions.</p>
                        <p>Sebenza's failure or delay to exercise any right or provision contained in the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, nor will it affect the validity of the of the Terms and Conditions, nor shall it prejudice Sebenza's right to take subsequent action against the offending User.
