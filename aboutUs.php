                                We are all about making the process of finding jobs, creating job opportunity for those who are currenty unemployed or seekinng
                                work. Our work is dedicated to Trade Workers, Home Users and Contractors. All of which can use our system and interact with any other user
                                to get work or to get work done. We strive to provide a fair environment in which Trade Workers, Contractors and Homeusers can interact with one
                                another to set up contracts, to complete these contracts and be reviewed by the users who create the contracts.
                            </p>

                            <p>This in turn builds up reliable recommendations through the people who use either a contractor or a tradeworker. Not only will our system be of use to the Tradeworkers in benefiting them in acquiring jobs,
                                but it will accumulate job recordings and essentially build up a "CV" for the user.
                                Tradeworkers will also have the ability to improve their CV's through recommendations and job history.</p>
